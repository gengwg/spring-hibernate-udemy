### Spring Container

primary functions:

* create and manage objects (inversion of control)
* inject object's dependencies (dependency injection)

sprint container is ApplicationContext.

#### FAQ: What is a Spring Bean?

A "Spring Bean" is simply a Java object.

When Java objects are created by the Spring Container, then Spring refers to them as "Spring Beans".

Spring Beans are created from normal Java classes .... just like Java objects.

In the early days, there was a term called "Java Beans". Spring Beans have a similar concept but Spring Beans do not follow all of the rigorous requirements of Java Beans.

---

In summary, whenever you see "Spring Bean", just think Java object. :-)

When we pass the interface to the method, behind the scenes Spring will cast the object for you.

context.getBean("myCoach", Coach.class)  

However, there are some slight differences than normal casting.

From the Spring docs:

Behaves the same as getBean(String), but provides a measure of type safety by throwing a BeanNotOfRequiredTypeException if the bean is not of the required type. This means that ClassCastException can't be thrown on casting the result correctly, as can happen with getBean(String).

Spring is a object factory. it's responsible for creating the objects and also injecting their dependencies.

dependency = helper


FAQ: What is the purpose for the no arg constructor?

Question:
I was wondering why you created a no arg constructor? I thought that they are implied by Java and only required when you also have an overloaded constructor. Or is this a Spring specific thing?

Answered by: Oleksandr Palamarchuk

When you don’t define any constructor in your class, compiler defines default one for you, however when you declare any constructor (in your example you have already defined a parameterized constructor), compiler doesn’t do it for you.

Since you have defined a constructor in class code, compiler didn’t create default one. While creating object you are invoking default one, which doesn’t exist in class code. Then the code gives an compilation error.

For "prototype" scoped beans, Spring does not call the destroy method.  Gasp!


---

In contrast to the other scopes, Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a prototype bean: the container instantiates, configures, and otherwise assembles a prototype object, and hands it to the client, with no further record of that prototype instance.

Thus, although initialization lifecycle callback methods are called on all objects regardless of scope, in the case of prototypes, configured destruction lifecycle callbacks are not called. The client code must clean up prototype-scoped objects and release expensive resources that the prototype bean(s) are holding.
